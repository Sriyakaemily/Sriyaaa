        <h4>5. Faactory</h4>
            <h5>Released on September 3rd</h5>
          <p>‘Faactory’ narrates the same old story of a young man's obsession with a girl he wants by hook or by crook. But from the way this tale’s shaped up to the way the makers have executed it on screen, we would say that this factory tour is not worth your time.
